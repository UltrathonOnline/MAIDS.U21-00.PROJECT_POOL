The present dataset was created for machine learning in order to improve the prediction 
of bloodstream infections. The dataset combines clinical blood parameters, age, sex as 
well as previous admissions to blood culturing results (negative and positive) and 
resistance profile of the infecting pathogen over a period of more than 10 years.

The purpose was to offer quantities of videos to enable the development of motion correction
algorithms for subsequent data acquisition. The algorithm/program should be able to
accurately adjust which pixels are sampled within each frame to keep a Region-of-Interest
within the target area and, thus, produce a more sensitive and accurate quantification.

```

@: Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark

Research on consciousness is mainly based on patients suffering from chronic brain injury,
while data regarding unresponsive patients with acute brain injury are sparse. As mentioned
in the previous section, most deaths in an ICU population occur because of withdrawal of
life-sustaining therapy. Reducing the risk for erroneous clinical prognostication is
therefore crucial. There is a gap between the research on chronic patients and research
based on unresponsive patients suffering from acute brain injury in the ICU. We established
our database to be able to fill this gap. Our dataset was hence created to obtain a
representative prospective database with systematic registration of clinical, laboratory
and imaging data of unresponsive patients suffering from acute brain injury. The main purpose
of the database is to identify important information predicting level of consciousness and
outcome (acute and long-term) in these patients, which will help to optimize clinical
decision-making.

The sudden emergence of a global pandemic with a new pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, created an instant
need to understand the immunologic reactions arising in response to infection with this pathogen,
as well as understanding the underlying patient-specific factors determining the circumstances
within which these immune reactions occur. As a result, the current dataset was created, combining
whole genome sequencing with consecutive extensive characterization of patient immune cell
composition and phenotypes together with in vitro functional assessment of stimulated whole blood
immune responses. The current dataset provides a unique opportunity to unravel correlations
between genotype and immune phenotype- and function in response to COVID-19, which could
ultimately have significant clinical impact.

To provide a deeper understanding of pharmacogenetics/-kinetics/-dynamics of MT and increase
cure rates for childhood leukemia. The datasets emerge from two Nordic childhood leukemia
protocols (ALL92: 1992-2006) and ALL2008 (2008-2018).

Infections are the leading cause of mortality in CLL. Risk of Infection is increased upon CLL
treatment and currently we have no model that is able to predict risk of infection upon CLL
treatment. The dataset created puts together various sources of time-series electronic health
records on CLL patients in Denmark. This also includes outcome on death, treatment and infection.
Using this data set we aim to both model risk of infection upon CLL treatment and uncover risk
factors responsible for low immune function and duration of treatment response upon different
treatment regimens.

Based on one of the world's largest patient cohorts with metagenomic sequenced fecal samples we
wanted to describe the interplay between previous treatment with antibiotics and presence of
antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In order to do this, we have established a bioinformatic
pipeline to map antibiotic resistance genes and we have established an automatic way of extracting
data on use of antibiotics (anti-bacteria, -virus, -fungi), immunosuppressants and chemotherapy.
Moreover, we have detailed data on demographics, clinical outcomes and other microbiome features
such as taxonomy.
